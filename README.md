### Notes:
The webapp by default will try to connect to `http://localhost:8000` but this behavior can be modifed by create a .env file and copy and paste the following 

    REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL = "https://snack-in-a-van-back-end.herokuapp.com"


### sample test users
Note that we create these test users before the password requirements, the password requirements are implemented and user signup later must adhere to these requirements
For vendor: username:`vendor3`, password: `vendor3` and username:`vendor5`, password: `vendor5`
For user:   username: `hello`, password: `hello` or you can just do a signup. 




## Notes for deliverable 3
Dummy users for testing username `hello`, password `hello`, you can also signup at `/Signup`
Please use `mongodb+srv://userWIT:somePassword@cluster0.v20k5.mongodb.net/cluster0?retryWrites=true&w=majority` to access database


Dummy vendor for testing username `vendor3`, password `vendor3`
